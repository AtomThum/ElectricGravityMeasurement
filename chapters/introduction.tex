\chapter{Introduction}

One of the dream that most physics student pursue is to be able to measure the Earth's gravitational acceleration from every physical quantities accessible, whether it would be the period of a pendulum, the surface tension of water, the timing of a ball bearing, etc. I also share that dream; thus, I choose to measure Earth's gravitational acceleration using electromagnetic induction.

As we shall see in \cref{sec:related-works}, there already has been multiple times when these form of experiments have been conducted. But they require quite a complicated setup. So in this work, I challenge myself to work with the most basic setup there is: a magnet, a single solenoid, and an oscilloscope.

\paragraph{Hypothesis} It is possible to measure the Earth's gravitational constant using electromagnetic induction.

\paragraph{Objectives} To measure the Earth's gravitational constant using electromagnetic induction in the simplest way possible.
